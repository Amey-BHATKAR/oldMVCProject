This was my internship project.

This project I have done mainly in PHP 4. But it supports a lot of different functionalities like JDGraph and GeoLocation.

The main files are in controllers and views. As it wasn't Object Oriented, the model part of the code is not seperated.

Most of the code is self explanatory, but I have included the full report on the project, if there is a further need for description.
